# Assignment 2 for Algorithms and Data Structure

## NQueen problem 
* The idea is to write an algorithm such that in a n * n board , n queens are placed such 
that no two queens can attack (control) each other. A queen in chess can move horizontally
vertically and diagonally, and it is the strongest piece of chess. A backtracking algorithm 
has been implemented to solve this problem. 
  
           Note : The solution is only possible for n*n boards such that n >= 4.


## Utopia Coins

* In utopia they have four types of coins: 1, 7, 10, 22
* We want an algorithm to find the minimum number of coins for a given amount N.
* For eg : To get 15 , we can have 1 * 10 + 5 * 1 = 6 coins or 7 * 2 + 1 * 1 =3 coins. We can have 15 with only three coins.

The solution has been implemented using dynamic programming.
